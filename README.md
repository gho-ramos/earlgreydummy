Study Test Project

- UI Test Framework:
https://github.com/google/EarlGrey

- BDD Test Framework:
https://github.com/Quick/Quick

I'm using Carthage as a dependency manager for this project

- Clone the repository
- Update the project dependencies with  **carthage update --platform ios**
- If you don't have ruby installed,  [setup your ruby environment](https://github.com/google/EarlGrey/blob/master/docs/install-and-run.md#install-ruby) and install earlgrey gem
- After your environment is all set, just try running a test (or just ![CMD](https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/interface-line-set/24/icn-key-cmd-24.png) + U)
